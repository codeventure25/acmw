# ACM-W CTF Practice Repo

Welcome, code sleuth ðŸ–¤

Within these commits lie whispers of forgotten efforts. Not all traces are meaningfulâ€”some are noise, others hide the key in plain sight.

Guidelines for your pursuit:
- Traverse the timeline carefully; some paths are red herrings.
- Pay attention to words, their forms, and subtle distinctionsâ€”sometimes lowercase matters.
- Patterns may reveal themselves only if observed with care.
- Sequence mattersâ€”history is a map, not a jumble.
- The most active clubâ€™s imprints might illuminate the final secret.
- When you think you have the key, the answer will take the form: `club{hidden_word}`.

Notice the nuances, observe the ordinaryâ€”sometimes what seems trivial carries the treasure.
